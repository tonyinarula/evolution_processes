# Characterizing Evolutionary Processes in Animals

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop an understanding of three different processes of evolution.

## Dataset
Data for this project was accessed from various scientific articles that independently discussed evolution.

## Tools Used
R (tidyverse, ggplot2)

## Key Questions
What long-term trends can be identified in key metrics across time and populations?

Are there meaningful shifts in trait distributions between defined cohorts (species, regions, or time periods)?

Do observed changes represent stable patterns, directional movement, or increasing polarization across groups?

How consistent are trends across comparable datasets, and where do divergences occur?

What assumptions underlie the analytical models and visualizations, and how might they affect interpretation?

Which visual encodings most effectively communicate distributional change to non-technical stakeholders?

## Key Findings
Figure 1: Stabilizing selection in Arctic reindeer birth mass (1990–2015)

Figure 2: Directional selection in finch beak length and depth (1975–2012)

Figure 3: Divergent selection in poison dart frog mating calls by region

## Data Cleaning & Assumptions
Removed incomplete or malformed records to ensure consistent trait comparisons across years and populations

Standardized variable names and units across datasets collected from different sources

Aggregated individual-level measurements to population-level summaries where appropriate

Assumed sampled individuals were representative of their respective populations and time periods

Applied smoothing and linear models only where trends were biologically meaningful and statistically interpretable
